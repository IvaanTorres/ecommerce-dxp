# Components
Reusable files which are used through the whole app.

## Atoms
* Little pieces of code which are highly customisable such as buttons, typographies, etc.
* These components may have many variants, showed through StoryBook.
* The atom components don't have story interactions, as difference of some molecules and organisms components.

## Molecules
* Mix of atom components which are used to create a bigger and specific component.
* These components might have some variants, showed through StoryBook.
* The molecule components may have story interactions, specially hte most complex ones.

## Organisms
* Mix of molecule components which are used to create a bigger and specific component.
* These components don't usually have any variants since they use to be quite complex.
* The organism components use to have story interactions because of their complexity.
